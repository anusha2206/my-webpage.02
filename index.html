     <h1> SUNRISE </h1>
     <i><p1> Sunrise is the moment when the upper rim of the Sun appears on the horizon in the morning.</i></p1>
     <i><p2>What are few lines about rising sun?</i></p2>
     <i><p3>The day can never start without the sunrise. It gives us light, and the rays help us synthesise vitamin D, which is essential for our body. There are also some harmful rays coming out of the sun called UV rays. Our earth is surrounded by an atmosphere that protects us from harmful UV rays. </i></p3>
     <i><p4>These sunrise quotes will inspire you to catch the morning sun. Few things in life are more glorious than the first hint of the morning sun breaking through the horizon. As hues of golden yellow, orange, and red light up the sky at daybreak, the rising sun is a reminder that each morning is the start of a new beginning.</i></p4>
