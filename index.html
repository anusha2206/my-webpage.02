     <h1> Sunrise </h1>
     <i><p> Sunrise is the moment when the upper rim of the Sun appears on the horizon in the morning.The sunrise is one of Nature's finest moments, and often disputes the preferences with sunsets. The golden hour can be hypnotic and mesmerizing.

But for early birds and dawn patrol surfers, there's really nothing more magical than dawn.

Poets, painters, musicians, and artists, in general, have always brought sunrises into their work, dazzled by their magnetism and power.

Can you still remember the last time you were hypnotized by the smell of that first day of Spring, early in the morning?

Sunrises only bring fresh new starts. Whether it's rainy or sunny, dawn - or the first light of day - is a synonym for genesis. </i></p>
